# 🧭 Project Overview 

This project provides a free and local alternative to cloud-based language models. It offers a fully local experience of LLM Chat, Retrieval Augmented Generation App, and a Vector Database Chat. Run the streamlit app locally and create your own Knowledge Base.

## 🚧 Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed.
- Mistral 7B installed.

## 🎛 Project Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Mistral 7B for your operating system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the streamlit application using `streamlit run main.py`.
5. Open the application in your browser
6. Enjoy!
